# API for Partydox Built with NodeJS-Express-Knex-PG :tada:

The back end portion of this full stack app is contained in this repository. I came up with this idea while on vacation with some friends and thought it would be really fun to build! So here it is! Its a web platform where friends can create trips, add activities, shopping lists, flights, and parking lots, and eventually will be able to update profiles and share trips with friends to collaborate.
